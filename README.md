# Dicecloud V2 Unofficial User Guide

This is an unofficial guide for users and library developers working with [Dicecloud V2](https://beta.dicecloud.com). This guide is written by users, for users, and is not officially sponsored or maintained by Thaum, the developer of Dicecloud.

## Getting Started

Most users can access and use the Dicecloud V2 beta for free, including all functionality needed for creating your own sheets, as well as the ability to subscribe to and use existing content libraries. If you want to create libraries for other users to import content from, you will need one of two things:

* A Patreon account backing [Dicecloud on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dicecloud) at the Adventurer tier ($5/month) or above.
* An invite from a Patron of the Hero tier ($10/month) or above.

If you are using your own Patreon account, the first thing you'll need to do is create a Dicecloud account. You can sign in with Google, Patreon, or create a new account; I recommend creating your account through Patreon, but you can link your Patreon successfully to any of the above by accessing the Account menu with the gear icon in the top left.

If you are using an invite provided by a Patron, the person inviting you will need to send you an invite link. From there, you can either create your account or sign into an existing one to access the site.

Another option is to self-host V2. This has some additional limitations that aren't present in the live version, namely being unable to subscribe to libraries that you haven't made and needing to some edits to either the code or account database in order to use V2. It does however, have the benefit of being free and allowing you to make edits to the code if you want to add something that isn't already present. Instructions for self-hosting can be found in the readme for [DiceCloud](https://github.com/ThaumRystra/DiceCloud/blob/version-2/README.md).

## Libraries

The most basic concept in V2 is the library system. Libraries are shareable resources, created by users, of pre-created content which can be used in your sheets. After following a library share link, you can subscribe to the library with the "Subscribe" button at the top right, after which you can freely use its contents in your own character sheets.

The most reliable and up-to-date list of libraries for all purposes can be found on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/qEvdfeB), in the #version-2-libraries channel.

## Further Help

This guide is a work in progress, and could never hope to cover everything V2 is capable of. If you find yourself needing any additional help, you can reach out to the community through the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/qEvdfeB).
