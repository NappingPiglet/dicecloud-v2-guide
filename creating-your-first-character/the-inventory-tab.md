# The Inventory Tab

The Inventory tab is the primary place where you can manage your items. While you can't currently add new items through the Inventory tab (you'll need to head to either the Tree tab or the Build view for that), you can organize your items and manage the amounts of each item you're carrying.

Clicking the red abacus buttons shown on some items will let you adjust the amount you're currently carrying. The six dots on the right-hand side of a given item in the list will let you drag and drop it to change its order in the list, or move it to another container. Clicking on an item will open a detailed view with its description and further information, including weight, value, and current amount.

You can also click the heading of a given container list to view similar details about that container. All characters have built in "Carried" and "Equipped" containers, which have special functionality (for example, items with attacks need to be in Equipped to show on the Stats tab) and no details view.
