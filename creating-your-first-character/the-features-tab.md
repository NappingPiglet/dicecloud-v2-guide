# The Features Tab

The next tab you'll want to look at is the Features tab. This is the simplest tab to understand by far; it's just a detailed list of your character's abilities. Each feature shows as a card, like this:

![A feature card for the Barbarian's Rage ability.](/dicecloud-v2-guide/assets/feature.png)

By clicking on the heading of the card, you can see a more detailed view of the feature:

![The detail view of the above card.](/dicecloud-v2-guide/assets/feature-detail.png)

In the detailed view, below the feature's description, you can also see the children of the feature, which are various things related to the functionality of that feature. You shouldn't normally need to worry about these, but you can click around and explore them if you like.
