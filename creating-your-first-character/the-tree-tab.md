# The Tree Tab

The Tree tab is where all the structure that makes up a Dicecloud character sheet lives. Here you can dig into how your character sheet actually works, or change it to your heart's content.

<p class="hint danger">
The Tree tab is an advanced feature, and you should rarely ever need to touch it in the course of normal character use. In order to access it, you will need to go to your character settings and enable the toggle labelled "Show Tree Tab". As V2 is still in heavy development, there are some cases where you'll need to work in the Tree - like for adding items, spells, etc. if slots don't exist for them - but those will eventually be moved more and more away from the Tree tab and towards slots or dedicated UI sections on the appropriate tabs.

<p class="hint info">
If you're building homebrew materials or other things you may want to reuse, it's recommended that you work in the Library section in the sidebar instead. Most of the principles are the same as working in a character's Tree tab, but it will keep you from having to do your work multiple times for future characters.

Clicking on a property in the Tree tab will display its details on the right-hand side, or in a popup on mobile. The arrow on the left-hand side of a property will expand it to show its children. The search field at the top left will allow you to filter the tree by property type.

## Edit Mode

The pencil icon at the top right will switch your view into edit mode, which allows you to change the settings of any property. You can find the edit button at the top right of details cards on other tabs as well. You'll stay in edit mode even if you switch to a different property or away from the Tree tab, until you click the checkmark at the top right to exit edit mode.

You can add a new property or import one from a library by clicking the + button in the bottom right. See the [Documentation for Properties](../documentation-for-properties/action.md) section for details on different property types and their settings.

Once you're in edit mode, you can also duplicate or delete a property from the three dots at the top right, or change the property's color with the paint roller button.

## Organize Mode

Turning on the Organize switch at the top left will put your tree into organize mode, which will allow you to move properties within the tree by dragging and dropping on the two horizontal bars. It also allows you to expand properties with no children, so that you can drag other properties into them.

<p class="hint info">
When working in either a character's tree or library, properties will be added at the bottom of the list if the property selected currently is not expanded. If it is expanded, then it will be added as the bottommost child of the selected property.
