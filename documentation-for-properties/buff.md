# Buffs

A buff is an effect that is given to a creature as a result of an action. These primarily will store children that serve to grant features or modify attributes. These are intended to represent a temporary addition or subtraction to a creature's power or abilities.

## Components

### Name

The name of this buff, which is displayed next to the buff icon on the stats page.

### Applied

When set to true, the buff is active on the character and its children are active as well. When set to false, the buff will be duplicated with the value set to active when it is applied by an action.

Setting a buff to have this value as true in a library allows for the creation of character-universal buffs, such as grappled or poisoned, which can be added to the character from the stats page.

### Description

A long description of the buff, which will appear when you click on the buff's name on the stats tab. This field accepts markdown, HTML, and calculations within {}.

### Target \(Required\)

The target of the buff and the way that all rolled effects of the buff's children will be calculated.

* Self
  * You are the victim of the attribute damage.
* Roll Once for Each Target
  * Each creature that the buff effects will have the dice for the children rolled separately.
* Roll once and Apply to Every Target
  * The dice will be rolled once and that value will be used for every creature the effect targets.

### Tags

Tags are used to control which slots this property can be added to. This will usually be left blank unless you're making a library.
