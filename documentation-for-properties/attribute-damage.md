# Attribute Damage

Attribute damage is a way of causing an [action](action.md) or [attack](attack-action.md) to reduce an ability score, resource, or other attribute. They do nothing unless they are the child of an action in the tree, and only change the value of the attribute when you take that action.

## Components

### Attribute

The variable name of the attribute this property will affect.

### Damage

The amount that the attribute will be modified by or to. This can be either a number or calculation.

### Operation \(Required\)

What the attribute damage will do to the attribute.

* Damage
  * The attribute will have its value decremented by the value of the attribute damage.
* Set
  * The attribute will have its current value set to the value of the attribute damage.

### Target \(Required\)

The target of the attribute damage and the way that the damage will be calculated if a roll is involved in the damage field.

* Self
  * You are the victim of the attribute damage.
* Roll Once for Each Target
  * Each creature that the attribute damage effects will have the dice for the damage rolled separately.
* Roll once and Apply to Every Target
  * The dice will be rolled once and that value will be used for every creature the effect targets.

### Tags

Tags are used to control which slots this property can be added to. This will usually be left blank unless you're making a library.
